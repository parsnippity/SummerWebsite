                <h2>Disney World</h2>
                <p>In early June, me and my family went to Disney World for a week. Our flight there was delayed for several hours, and as soon as we arrived I felt the humidity. We did four days at the parks, one at each, and we did horseback riding at one of the resorts. We got to ride the new Tron and Guardians of the Galaxy rides, and one night, me and my mom were on the Skyliner during the fireworks, and it was a very nice view. Last time we went I had a broken leg, so even though I'd been before it was a slightly different but no less enjoyable experience.</p>

                <h2>Sick</h2>
                <p>Two days after we got back from Disney World, I got sick. There were only one or two days where I really felt sick, but I was still unwell for about a week and a half. The worst part was that my sleep wasn't restful, so when I got tired and tried to take a little nap, I woke up feeling horrible. I mostly spent it watching TV, and I knew I was all the way better when I had enough energy that I got bored after watching a few episodes of something.</p>

                <h2>Escape Room</h2>
                <p>I did an escape room with some of my friends one afternoon. It was the second one I'd ever done, but unlike the first one, we actually escaped. We did need some hints, but we figured most of it out ourselves and we had a lot of time left at the end. It was very fun and had more complicated gadgets than the other one I did. We went for boba after and hung out at the shop for a bit. It was one of the only things I did with my friends this summer, because for a while I was out of town or sick.</p>
