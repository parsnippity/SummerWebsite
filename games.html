                <h2>Scarlet Nexus</h2>
                <p>I started playing this game before the summer, but I finished it during July. I usually play puzzle games, so this, an action game, was a little different, but I still had a lot of fun playing it. I enjoyed the battle mechanics and how it let me alter my own attacks by borrowing the powers of my party members. On the night I finished it, there were about three hours without a save point, which was rough because it forced me to stay up later than I like to, but it was still really fun.</p>

                <h2>Undertale</h2>
                <p>I watched my sister play this game a few months, maybe a year ago, but I never saw the ending. So when I was looking for a new game to play, I decided to play this game for myself and finally see the ending. I finished it in a few days and I really enjoyed it (I got a different ending than my sister did, so I've been trying to get her to replay it and get that ending, as of yet unsuccessfully). I haven't got all the endings yet, because I got stuck on a boss battle and got bored, but I still really enjoyed playing it.</p>

                <h2>End Roll</h2>
                <p>This was a free game I downloaded and played on my computer. I mostly played it because I was bored, but it was really good. It's an RPG psychological horror adventure game that I found through Etsy, and even though I don't have much experience with RPG adventure games like this, I didn't really struggle with the battles, which was nice. I enjoyed meeting the characters and learning their stories and seeing how it descended from adventure into horror. I finished it in a week, but there are a few things I missed the first time around, so I'm planning to replay it.</p>
